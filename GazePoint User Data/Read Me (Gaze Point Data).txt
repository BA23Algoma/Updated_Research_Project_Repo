RecordingGazePointID — Corresponds to the gaze point recording, the user Id is auto generated by gaze point (each ID relates to a single recording file)
MatlabID — Participant ID set by the testing proctor, random number used to anonymize data
Condition — Represents the two conditions of the experiment. (Proximal and Distal vs. Distal)
Learningvs.Performance — Indicates whether the trial was the learning or the performance for the maze run
MazeOrder — Indicates the order in which the maze were performed by the participant , (0 - represents the practice maze)
MazeIdenity— Represent the specific maze file used to populate the 3D environment found within the project maze folder
AOI — (Area of Interest) Indicates the 4 settings of the experiment. Sky ( Area above the wall), Lower (Area including the ground and maze walls), Proximal and Distal
AOI_Time — The total time the user spent gazing at the specified AOI( Recorded in seconds)
HesistancyTime — Total time the user spent stationary, hesitancy records the time the user x & Y remained the same for longer than 1 second. i.e. If the suer were to remain stationary for 4 seconds total, the hesitancy time of that instance would be 3 seconds.
TotalTrialTime— Total time the trial (Recorded in seconds)
AverageHeartRate— Mean average heart rate over the condition
AverageGalvanicSkinRate— Mean average galvanic skin rate over the condition
LastInsideAOIFixation— Counts the total number of continuous fixation within an AOI
LastOutsideAOIFixation— Counts the number of times the gaze entered the AOI region, i.e. If an individual were to look at the distal cue, look toward the proximal cue and then back to the distal cue the distal cue would now have a count of 2 LastOutsideAOIFixation. (Tracks the fixation if the previous fixation was outside the AOI region)
TotalFixation— Corresponds to the total number of fixations over the trial

Data is set to be outputted in the Gazepoint user data\ Processed Data folder with Maze project. The user_data function is used to process data. If the save files exist within the output folder, the processed data will be appended to the existing files.

Note — Fixations were set and provided by Gazepoint
