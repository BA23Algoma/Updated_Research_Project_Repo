//The next 10 walls represent the outer walls of the maze. Using a top down
// view of the maze, the 4 values are represents the (x,y) values of two...
//points used to form a line, which corresponds to the location of the wall. 
//The image file name is the texture to applied to said wall. Example.
0.5	0.0	6.0	0.0	Rock.bmp

//Following the 10 walls are the inner wall of the maze, all rock textures.
//Example (no texture because all are assumed to be rock walls)
6.0	4.0	3.0	4.0

//After all the walls is the dital queue location, using the same co-ordinate... 
//system as the walls(x,y). Two locations are given. One is used at random.
//Example
5.0	5.0	-5.0	-5.0

//Lastly is the peripehral Queue, same as the distal queue but the two points...
//Represent two diffirent objects
